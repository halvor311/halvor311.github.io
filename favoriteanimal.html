<p>This is by far the scariest creature on the planet. Unlike the Lion, Tiger
    and Bear, if you encounter this guy, you are WAY out of your element. Unlike
    the Lion Tiger and Bear, this guy is not as likely to try to eat you. Contrary
    to modern movies, most notably "Jaws" attacks from this particular animal are incredibly rare. Only an average of 6 
    attacks per year are reported. However, I wouldn't recommend seaking these
    guys out. They can be very aggressive, especially when they're hungry. If you
    encounter one there are several things you need to do: <ul>
        <li>DO NOT PANIC <br> When you panic you tend to attract the animal
        This will only bring the creature closer to you.</li>
        <li>LOOK AT IT <br> Great Whites like to attack from below.
        If you look at it, it'll scurry away like rats having a light shone
        upon them. This is very well illustrated in the movie 47 Meters Down.</li>
            
    </ul>
